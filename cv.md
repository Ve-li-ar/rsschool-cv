### Briefly About Myself:
If I started earlier, I graduated from medical college almost 10 years ago. <br>

I started self-studying  html and css courses in 2020. Then I finished courses on frontend-developer. <br>
We worked as a team with two girls.  Our teachers advised us to unite in pairs.  And at first we worked together, later we took a third girl to our team.  We helped each other, explained, looked for answers to questions
It was in twenty-twenty one. And now I am learning JS.<br>

After finishing courses, I found work in a company that specializes in working with neural networks. 
My work is quality control of neural networks. <br>

My last project is a start-page for a company from Minsk. It has the largest network shops. My friend works there and I did this project for her. It is a title page for their system. It contains two blocks with text, images, lists, pseudo-elements. It is a very simple project. I used flex-boxes, lists, and pseudo-elements. Besides, I wrote some javascript projects that were a little intensive. They are small, but interesting for me. There are event listener, cycles 'for' and ‘if…else’, add class, add style, method Math.random, element search through id, style, change default browser action through ‘preventdefault’ and other methods JS. <br>
